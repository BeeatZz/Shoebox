The "Feeding System" has been integrated directly into the existing "InputManagerHook" script to simplify setup.

Please perform the following steps in the Unity Editor to enable feeding:

1.  Locate the "InputManagerHook" component in your scene (usually on an object named "Managers", "InputManager", or "System").
2.  In the Inspector, verify that the "Food Prefab" field is visible.
3.  Assign the "Marshmallow" prefab (located in Assets/Prefabs/Marshmallow.prefab) to this field.
4.  Set the "Floor Layer" mask to include the layer your floor is on (e.g., "Default" or "Floor").
5.  Play the game, press 'F' to enable feeding mode, and click on the floor to spawn food!
