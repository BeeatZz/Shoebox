To ensure the Currency Manager is functioning correctly and currency is being produced:

1.  **Create CurrencyManager GameObject:**
    *   In the Unity Editor, go to your scene Hierarchy.
    *   Right-click -> Create Empty.
    *   Rename this new GameObject to `CurrencyManager`.

2.  **Attach `CurrencyManager.cs` Script:**
    *   Drag and drop the `Assets/Scripts/Managers/CurrencyManager.cs` script onto the `CurrencyManager` GameObject in the Inspector.

This step is crucial because `CurrencyManager` is a MonoBehaviour Singleton, meaning it needs to be attached to an active GameObject in the scene for its `Instance` to be correctly initialized and accessible by other scripts (like `TaskProduceCurrency`).

After performing these steps, run the scene and verify:
*   Currency is being produced (check the console for `Current Currency` logs).
*   Grems are moving and flipping their sprites.
