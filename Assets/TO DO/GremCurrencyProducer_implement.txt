To enable the Grem to produce currency:

1.  **Select Grem Prefab(s):**
    *   In the Unity Editor, navigate to your `Assets/Prefabs` folder (or wherever your Grem prefabs are located).
    *   Select all Grem prefabs that should produce currency (e.g., "BasicGrem.prefab").

2.  **Add `GremCurrencyProducer` Component:**
    *   In the Inspector window, click the "Add Component" button.
    *   Search for "Grem Currency Producer" and select the `GremCurrencyProducer` script to add it to your Grem prefabs.

Now, when these Grems are active in the scene, they will produce currency according to their `GremData` settings (value, rate, and reductions based on hunger/energy).

Remember to ensure your `CurrencyManager` is correctly set up in the scene as per `Assets/TO DO/CurrencyManager_implement.txt`.
