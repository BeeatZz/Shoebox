To ensure physics-based dragging works correctly for your Grems, you must perform the following manual setup in the Unity Editor:

1.  **Select Grem Prefab(s):**
    *   In the Unity Editor, navigate to your `Assets/Prefabs` folder (or wherever your Grem prefabs are located).
    *   Select all Grem prefabs that should be draggable.

2.  **Add `Rigidbody` Component:**
    *   In the Inspector window for your Grem prefab, click the "Add Component" button.
    *   Search for "Rigidbody" and select it to add a 3D Rigidbody component to your Grem.

3.  **Configure Rigidbody (Crucial):**
    *   With the Rigidbody component added, inspect its settings:
        *   **`Use Gravity`**: Ensure this is **enabled** (checked). The dragging script will temporarily disable it when dragging starts.
        *   **`Is Kinematic`**: Ensure this is **disabled** (unchecked). The dragging script will temporarily set it to false when dragging starts.
        *   **`Freeze Rotation`**: Expand the "Constraints" section and ensure **all three (X, Y, Z)** rotation axes are **checked** (frozen). This prevents the Grem from rotating uncontrollably when force is applied.
        *   **`Collision Detection`**: Set to `Continuous` or `ContinuousDynamic` for better collision detection, especially if the Grem moves fast.

4.  **Set `Drag Pull Force` in `GremData`:**
    *   Select your `GremData` ScriptableObject asset (e.g., `Assets/Scripts/GremData/GremDatas/BasicGrem.asset`).
    *   In the Inspector, locate the "Movement" section and adjust the `Drag Pull Force` value. A good starting point might be `50` to `100`, but you can tweak this to make the drag feel more or less responsive.

After performing these steps, run the scene and test dragging. The Grem should now physically collide with walls instead of passing through them.
